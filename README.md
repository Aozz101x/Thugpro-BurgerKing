Burger King mascot from the game Sneak King from Xbox/Xbox 360. credits to lemurboy12 for the model. 

Replace the Model .tex and .skin in C:\Program File (x86)\Activision\Tony Hawk's Underground 2\Game\Data\models in the following folders:
- Skater_Pro 
- Skater_Secrets
- Peds

make sure to rename them like the orginal files (ex: Skater_BKING.skin.xbx Skater_BKING.tex.xbx to Skater_Weeman.skin.xbx Skater_Weeman.tex.xbx or anyone else in those three folders above)

add the .ska in C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Local\THUG Pro\Save or whatever you have thugpro installed. :)

add the three skaterparts files in C:\Program File (x86)\Activision\Tony Hawk's Underground 2\Game\Data\Pre
